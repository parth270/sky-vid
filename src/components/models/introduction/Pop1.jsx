        The term “metaverse” is regularly used as marketing shorthand for any
        virtual space or augmented reality in which users interact with
        digitally generated or enhanced environments and other users, often via
        digital versions of themselves. Enterprises can work with this
        definition to develop better virtualized customer, employee, and partner
        experiences and to upskill in preparation for the needs of future
        customers. We asked providers to also consider the future direction of
        the metaverse—where it becomes an open and interoperable driver of an
        emerging business paradigm disrupted by decentralization—and the impact
        of customer control of their own data.{" "}

          The value proposition for metaverse services is moving from a “return
