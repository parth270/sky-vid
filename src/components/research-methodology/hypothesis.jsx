            The potential for metaverse in the enterprise is accelerating apace.
            How effectively are enterprises uncovering its potential across
            their customers and employees by partnering with service providers
            and consultants?

          <ListChild>
            In answering this, we selected 18 leading service providers and
            consultants offering metaverse services, based on revenue,
            investment, declared strategy, and market momentum.

            As further detailed on page 16, we assessed each providerâ€™s value
            proposition (the Why?), execution and innovation criteria (the
            What?), go-to-market strategy (the How?), and market impact (the So
            What?).
          </ListChild>
          <ListChild>
            We assessed the combination of technology and services each provider
            is developing, applying, or partnering to deliver, many of which are
            captured on pages 17 and 18.

            vendors.
